    <div class="intro">
        <p><b>Web design</b> encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of
            websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design);
            authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and
            search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the
            design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is normally used to
            describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing
            markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers
            are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

        <h2 style="color: crimson;">HISTORY</h2>
        <h4>1988â€“2001</h4>
        <P>Although web design has a fairly recent history, it can be linked to other areas such as graphic design, user
            experience, and multimedia arts, but is more aptly seen from a technological standpoint. It has become a
            large part of people's everyday lives. It is hard to imagine the Internet without animated graphics,
            different styles of typography, background, videos and music. In November 1992, Cern was the first website
            to ever launch to go live. The web was announced on August 6, 1991, and CERN was the first website to go
            live on the World Wide Web. During this period, websites were structured by using the
        <table> tag which created numbers on the website. Eventually, web designers were able to find their way around
            it to create more structures and format. In early history, the structure of the websites was fragile and
            hard to contain, so it became very difficult to use them. In November 1993 ALIWEB was the first ever search
            engine to be created (Archie Like Indexing for the WEB).[2]</P>

    <div class="start">
        <h4>The start of the web and web design</h4>
        <p>In 1989, whilst working at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee proposed to create a global hypertext project, which later
            became known as the World Wide Web. From 1991 to 1993 the World Wide Web was born. Text-only HTML pages
            could be viewed using a simple line-mode web browser.[3] In 1993 Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, created the
            Mosaic browser. At the time there were multiple browsers, however the majority of them were Unix-based and
            naturally text-heavy. There had been no integrated approach to graphic design elements such as images or
            sounds. The Mosaic browser broke this mould.[4] The W3C was created in October 1994 to "lead the World Wide
            Web to its full potential by developing common protocols that promote its evolution and ensure its
            interoperability."[5] This discouraged any one company from monopolizing a propriety browser and programming
            language, which could have altered the effect of the World Wide Web as a whole. The W3C continues to set
            standards, which can today be seen with JavaScript and other languages. In 1994 Andreessen formed Mosaic
            Communications Corp. that later became known as Netscape Communications, the Netscape 0.9 browser. Netscape
            created its own HTML tags without regard to the traditional standards process. For example, Netscape 1.1
            included tags for changing background colours and formatting text with tables on web pages. From 1996 to
            1999 the browser wars began, as Microsoft and Netscape fought for ultimate browser dominance. During this
            time there were many new technologies in the field, notably Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, and Dynamic
            HTML. On the whole, the browser competition did lead to many positive creations and helped web design evolve
            at a rapid pace.[6]</p>

        <h4>Evolution of web design</h4>
        <p>In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and HTML
            tags. It was also the first browser to support style sheets, which at the time was seen as an obscure
            authoring technique and is today an important aspect of web design.[6] The HTML markup for tables was
            originally intended for displaying tabular data. However, designers quickly realized the potential of using
            HTML tables for creating complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as
            design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence over good markup structure, little attention was paid
            to semantics and web accessibility. HTML sites were limited in their design options, even more so with
            earlier versions of HTML. To create complex designs, many web designers had to use complicated table
            structures or even use blank spacer .GIF images to stop empty table cells from collapsing.[7] CSS was
            introduced in December 1996 by the W3C to support presentation and layout. This allowed HTML code to be
            semantic rather than both semantic and presentational and improved web accessibility, see tableless web
            design.

            In 1996, Flash (originally known as FutureSplash) was developed. At the time, the Flash content development
            tool was relatively simple compared to now, using basic layout and drawing tools, a limited precursor to
            ActionScript, and a timeline, but it enabled web designers to go beyond the point of HTML, animated GIFs and
            JavaScript. However, because Flash required a plug-in, many web developers avoided using it for fear of
            limiting their market share due to lack of compatibility. Instead, designers reverted to GIF animations (if
            they didn't forego using motion graphics altogether) and JavaScript for widgets. But the benefits of Flash
            made it popular enough among specific target markets to eventually work its way to the vast majority of
            browsers, and powerful enough to be used to develop entire sites.[7]</p>
